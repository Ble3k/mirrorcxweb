        <p class='rent-header-block__p-text'>For a large retail chain, it is often more profitable to build own agency like ours, than to pay for the contractor&#39;s services. And here we can be helpful. After all, it would be strange not to share experience in building teams focused on Quality Management and Customer Experience. We were walking 5 years to an ideal business model, were mistaken, were risking, were reforming structure, optimizing processes, and were developing software. Two-time annual sales growth leads us to believe that we build something right. Let&#39;s do it for you!</p>
